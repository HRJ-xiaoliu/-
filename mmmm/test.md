Here is the translated table:

| Earned Value Data   | Solution (Explanation Process)                                                                                             | Answer          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Earned Value (EV)   | EV represents the budgeted value of work completed.<br>EV = % of work completed × BAC = 5% × 10,000,000 = $500,000        | $500,000        |
| Schedule Variance (SV) | Schedule Variance indicates the difference between the budgeted value of work actually completed and the budgeted value of planned work.<br>SV = EV - BCWS<br>Where BCWS = 2 months × 1,000,000 = $2,000,000<br>SV = 500,000 - 2,000,000 = -$1,500,000 | -$1,500,000     |
| Cost Variance (CV)  | Cost Variance represents the difference between the earned value and the actual cost.<br>CV = EV - AC = 500,000 - 1,000,000 = -$500,000 | -$500,000       |
| Estimate at Completion (EAC) | EAC represents the total project cost forecast based on the current cost performance index.<br>EAC = BAC / CPI = 10,000,000 / 0.5 = $20,000,000 | $20,000,000     |
| Cost Performance Index (CPI) | CPI measures the value achieved for every dollar spent.<br>CPI = EV / AC = 500,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.5               | 0.5             |
| Schedule Performance Index (SPI) | SPI measures project schedule efficiency.<br>SPI = EV / BCWS = 500,000 / 2,000,000 = 0.25                     | 0.25            |
| Estimate to Complete (ETC) | ETC represents the estimated cost to complete the remaining work.<br>ETC = EAC - AC = 20,000,000 - 1,000,000 = $19,000,000 | $19,000,000     |
